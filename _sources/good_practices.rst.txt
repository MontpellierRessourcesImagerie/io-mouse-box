Good practices
==========================================


1. Placing the mice in boxes
----------------------------

- It is important that from the moment the start frame is passed, nothing obstructs the view of the given box.
- When you place your mice, make sure that you won't pass your arm in front of the box again to place another mouse.
- For example, let's say that you have for boxes B1, B2, B3 & B4 placed from left to right. And you are standing on the left.
- In this case, you will have to place the mice in the order: B4, B3, B2, B1. Otherwise, if you place B2 and then B3, your arm will pass in front of B2 when you place B3.

2. Drawing the polygons
------------------------

- The only rule to draw the polygons is to make sure they don't overlap with each other.
- If they overflow from a box, it doesn't matter.
- If you want to account for a mouse only if its hips passed the door, instead of drawing a huge polygon for the mouse area, just draw a shorter box. Note that you are not limited to a rectangle for your boxes.
